Human-AI co-reasoning system

Recent state-of-the-art commonsense reasoners are able to generate inferences with sub-graph evidence paths or paths from external structured commonsense knowledge graphs. However, such evidence tends to also posses a large amount of noisy knowledge which is detrimental to model prediction capability. In this project, we aim to utilize human intelligence to refine the evidence that the commonsense reasoner relies on. We propose a human-in-the-loop framework designed to improve the model's performance by eliciting human feedback on machine-generated evidence paths.
